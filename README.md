### Surface 
 
#### Colour Scheme 

I wanted a simple colour scheme, so I went 3 colours white (#FFFFFF), black (#000000), and orange (#E19B74). 
 
Black and white was chosen to make it simple and the orange was chosen as it is the exact match of the photo on the homepage. 
 
![Colours](https://github.com/raniamarhoni/SSK/blob/7cd5e3d9d01c8827f42ea92e1a2b50e8d582977a/Readme_links/images/Colours.png)

#### Typography
 
I picked 2 fonts to be used one for headers and one for general text. 
 
The 2 fonts are Amatic SC for headers and Abel for general text. 
 
![Fonts](https://github.com/raniamarhoni/SSK/blob/7cd5e3d9d01c8827f42ea92e1a2b50e8d582977a/Readme_links/images/Fonts.png)

These fonts were already being used on the packaging of the products and therefore I decided to keep the same theme throughout the site.
 
#### Images
 
Other than the product images only 1 other image has been used on the homepage to give a warm welcome feel that colour scheme was based around this photo as the background was orange and therefor orange was added to the colour scheme.
 
It is of hands with cream on them representing what the site sells Skin care e.g., creams. 
 
### Skeleton 
 
Once all the pages have been chosen and a design accepted, I then went to design each page on Adobe XD see below all the wireframes for each page.

While designing I also created 2 wireframes which will no longer be created

* [Payment Details Wireframe](https://github.com/raniamarhoni/SSK/blob/7cd5e3d9d01c8827f42ea92e1a2b50e8d582977a/Readme_links/wireframes/SSK%20-%20Payment%20Details.pdf)

### Structure 
 
The navbar and footer has access to everything that the type of user will need. 

#### Data Tables 

All the data is stored in SQL Database and Django to manage the storage as well.

How the tables are designed are all shown below.

**Site users**

Show images of table in Django.

**Products**

Show images of table in Django.

**Product sizes and prices**

Show images of table in Django.

**Reviews**

Show images of table in Django.

**Purchases Made**

Show images of table in Django.

**Basket**

Show images of table in Django.

### Scope 

Once all the user stories have been complete all the features needed for the site to meet the user stories are detailed below. 

**Sign up/in with social media**

I have done it so its easier for users to sign up or in by just connecting to social media or sign up through there email if they wish. 

**User experiences edit profile and delivery details**

Each user can easily log in and out with no problems. If a user forgets their password, they can easily recover it with their email. They can also save their delivery address to save them time if there a frequent customer and do not want to write there address every time they make a purchase. 

**Payment Details saved no longer will be done**

While designing I wanted a user to save their card details to save time when purchasing items but was informed about the security risk and the various laws around it. As internet browsers now save those details, I thought it better ittakes this out to avoid any security issues.

**Basket**

The total in the basket will always be shown in the navbar to let the shopper know how much is always in their basket.  

**Reviews**

Once a shopper has signed up and has purchased an item. They can leave a review for others to see and then once a new shopper has come to the site, they will then be able to see the reviews of the product and filter products on the best rated. 

**Checkout and Order confirmation**

When a shopper has purchased something, they will receive an email confirmation of what they have purchased and an order confirmation page which will detail what they have brought and all the information they have provided. So, shoppers will be able to have s record of what they have purchased. 

**Store owner to add, edit and delete a product**

The store owner will be able to add products to the store for shoppers to purchase. They can then edit the item in the future if they wish to put it on sale or add more stock for example and then delete the product of, they wish to no longer sell it. This is done by have form set up for them to allow this to happen. 
 
**Add multiple sizes and prices for a product** 

The store owner can save multiple sizes which will have different prices until each product. This is to avoid having the product save in twice under 2 products. This will make it easier to manage as the store owner can see everything associated with the product in one page when they add or edit. 

**Check for any available stock before payment**

Before a shopper purchases a product, it will make sure there is enough stock for what they want in case 2 people buy the same product at the same time and the product is out of stock. 

### Strategy 
 
My aim for this project is to build a website where all the user stories are met above. As a shopper, site user and store owner. Once I have outlined all the requirements, I will come up with a design scheme where I will make sure all wireframes made meet all the requirements of the user stories and design scheme. 

## Features
 
**Sign in with social media**

**Reviews**

**Each item has different sizes and prices**
I created 3 models to include 1 for categories they can go under body butters, creams etc. then one to hold all the details such as ingredients, description the last one is to hold the prices and sizes. When creating this I experimented with various ways to do it without the store owner having to put the same description and ingredients again while they can just enter it once with all the sizes and prices for them. 

### Existing Feat   ures

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

1.	Django 
2.	Python 
3.	HTML5
4.	CSS3 
5.	Bootstrap was used to manipulate the D.O.M
6.	JavaScript 

## Testing

### Django-allauth tests
I used django-allauth as it has all the features I need for the site and it is completely customizable and will allow me to add more functionality later and as it is an open source, so it is backed by millions of developers who keep it secure and up to date. 

While setting up allauth I ran some tests to make sure it works. 

**Checking I can log in and out. (1 test)**
As I created the superuser in the terminal I can check it works my adding ‘/admin’ to the page address when I open the project and see if I am able to log in using the superuser login I created in the terminal. 

**Verifying email tests (2 tests)**
1.	I went to setting.py and under the email set up in ‘LOGIN_REDIRECT_IRL = “/”’ I changed it to ‘LOGIN_REDIRECT_IRL = “/Success”’
2.	I opened the project and put ‘accounts/login’ at the end of the page address. 
3.	Signed in and if it says I must verify my email then it passed the first test(1st test checked)
4.	Then I went back and put ‘admin’ at the end of the page address making sure ‘accounts/login’ has been deleted from the page address.
5.	I Logged in and click email addresses. 
6.	Then I clicked on the email I put the superuser as and ticked verify and primary and saved. 
7.	I went back to ‘accounts/login’ at the end of the page address making sure ‘admin’ was gone and logged back in again.
8.	I logged in and if it says /success at the end of the page address it passed the second test (2nd test passed)
9.	I went back into setting.py and changed the code to ‘LOGIN_REDIRECT_IRL = “/”’. 

### Testing new templates or pages

Whenever creating a new page or template I would always check it works before writing any code by just putting a h1 header of ‘It works’ with bootstrap CSS on it of text-success where the text will come up green to make sure it works as the links are in the base template. 


### Responsive Design testing 
To check the code works on all screens. I used the inspect section of google chrome. Where I can change the screen size to see if the design will work on all screens. 

To go on the inspect section on google chrome I right clicked on the website and clicked on ‘Inspect’ then on the top left it then gives options to change the screen size. 

### Bugs

#### Bugs found in responsive design 

**Banner not on tablet or phone screens**
While testing the responsive design I found that the banner does not show on tablet or phone screens as it was behind the nav therefore I added padding to bring it down and made sure no padding was there when on large screens.
